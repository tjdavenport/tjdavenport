# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Torrance. I'm a Javascript/TypeScript programmer and aspiring rustacean. Take a look at some of my favorite personal projects ðŸ˜„:
- [rust-mod-studio](https://github.com/tjdavenport/rust-mod-studio) - A minimal C# IDE designed to make it easy for novice programmers to start creating plugins for Rust, the multiplayer survival game. It's built on TypeScript, React, Electron, and the Monaco text editor.
- [react-native-calorie-counter](https://github.com/tjdavenport/react-native-calorie-counter) - A simple mobile app for tracking macros - built on React Native.
- [svg-font-previews](https://github.com/tjdavenport/svg-font-previews) - A little script that can be used to generate tiny SVG previews of Google Fonts.

### âš¡ Fun Facts
- Monokai is my favorite color scheme.
- Vim is my primary text editor.
- I dabble with [photography](https://www.instagram.com/tjdavenport2/)
- I have a boxer named Oreo. He's black and white!

### ðŸ¤” Some of My Opinions
- Local development is more comfortable and more reliable than cross-environment development.
- Over-abstraction costs more than repetition.
- Integration testing creates more value than unit testing.
- I strongly prefer composition over inheritance.
- TypeScript is great, and Javascript is also great.
- The Javascript ecosystem is bloated.
- Javascript toolchains are fragile.
- It would be great if Javascript supported strong types. [It might someday](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations?tab=readme-ov-file).
